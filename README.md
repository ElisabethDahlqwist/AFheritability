# AFheritability
Shiny app for visualizing the relationship between the attributable fraction and heritability

This Shiny app is made to visualize how the attributable fraction (AF) can be expressed as a function of the heritability, prevalence, target group size and intervention effect. The formal relationship between the attributable fraction and the heritability is described in the article "On the relationship between the attributable fraction and the heritability" (Dahlqwist et. al).

The global.r file contain all code for the plots and AF estimates as well as help functions for the shiny app.
ui.r is the user interface file for the shiny app.
server.r is the server file for the shiny app.
